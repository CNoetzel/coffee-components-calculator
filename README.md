# Coffee Machine Accessories Calculator

This project calculates the required coffee machine components based on the orders.

The following table shows the ingredients for each type of coffee specialty.

| Type           | Coffee Powder | Milk            | Cocoa   |
| -------------- | ------------- | --------------- | ------- |
| Coffee         | 10 grams      | -               | -       |
| Cappucino      | 10 grams      | 200 milliliters | -       |
| Espresso       | 10 grams      | -               | -       |
| LatteMacchiato | 10 grams      | 200 milliliters | 5 grams |

We assume sticks for stirring the coffee will be used in 50% of the orders.

Executing the `.src/index.ts` function should return the total amount of ingredients for the given order quantities.
